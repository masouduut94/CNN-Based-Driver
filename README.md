# CNN-Based-Driver
A CNN car driver for the game of Speed Dreams 2.2.2.

I am using `Google net` to build an AI which simply reads screenshots and after processing the image, some steer controller is expected as output.

It still needs some configuration to deal with the overtraining.

Probable solutions:

1- Use transfer leaning to modify and train a pre-trained model. (saves us some time for training)

2- Use dropouts and collect more data

3- try to use better argmax coeffecients when mapping outputs to keys.

4- use more filters on input data to get it easier for NN to understand features.

DEAL WITH SOON!
